##What does it do?
###What Interactive Elements Exist?
There are two types of interactive elements on the page. The first are the two view changing buttons. the next are all the buttons to add the bottles to the user's cart.

###How do you interact with them?
All elements are interacted with via clicking on them.

###What visual effects are produced by interacting?
By clicking on the 'add to cart' button nothing happens. but clicking on the view changing buttons will change the layout of the elements on the page.

##How does it do it?
###What existing HTML elements are changed?
thats just the genius of it: no HTML elements are changed. or rather, they need not be. its just the stylesheets that need to change. well i suppose the link element needs to change, since thats where the stylesheet is linked. but thats all!

###What new HTML elements are created?
Same deal. No new html is needed. Its just a change of CSS.


###What CSS styles are used to produce the effect?
Well I suppose in the grid view, all the elements are inline-block, while in the list view, they're all block. I'm sure some of the spacing will have to change as well.
